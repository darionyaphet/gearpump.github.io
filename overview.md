Gearpump is a real-time big data streaming engine.
It is inspired by recent advances in the [Akka](http://akka.io/) framework and a desire to improve on existing streaming frameworks.
Gearpump is event/message based and featured as low latency handling, high performance, exactly once semantics,
dynamic topology update, [Apache Storm](https://storm.apache.org/) compatibility, etc.
